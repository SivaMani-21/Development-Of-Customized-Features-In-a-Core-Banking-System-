As part of my final semester internship, I am currently serving as a “Internship in Development of 
Customized features in a Core Banking System – PROFINCH SOLUTIONS”., a fintech firm 
specializing in delivering digital transformation solutions to banks and financial institutions. This role 
has allowed me to work closely with CBS (Core Banking System), where I actively engage in backend 
development and customization of core banking modules using PL/SQL. I am also gaining exposure 
to payment product processors, contributing to the development of microservices using Java Spring 
Boot, which supports scalable and modular financial applications. In addition, I have had the 
opportunity to work with an extendibility toolkit, enhancing productivity and accelerating 
development cycles. This internship is enriching my understanding of enterprise banking systems, 
reinforcing best practices in software development, and sharpening my analytical and collaboration 
skills. It offers a practical learning environment where I interact with real-world banking systems and 
contribute meaningfully to complex, enterprise-level fintech projects.
Throughout the internship, I have been involved in various stages of the software development 
lifecycle, including requirement analysis, design, coding, deployment, and collaboration with crossfunctional teams. I have worked on customizing and enhancing core modules within the CBS to meet 
specific client requirements, involving extensive use of PL/SQL procedures, triggers, and performance 
optimization techniques. On the payment product processor side, I have contributed to building 
RESTful APIs and reusable components using Java Spring Boot, aligning with microservice 
architecture principles. I have also participated in code reviews, sprint planning, and version control 
using Git. This hands-on experience has not only strengthened my technical proficiency but also 
provided insight into compliance standards, security protocols, and integration challenges in largescale financial systems.
